MAVUSO
Overview
Our proposed project is a dating application for private adult entertainers (a.k.a Service providers) and their clients. Clients will be able to request the services of their preferred entertainer and the entertainer will be able to either accept or reject the request based on the ability of the client to afford their rates.

Challenges
This project aims to help adult private entertainers connect with paying clients who seek their short-term services. Clients will be informed about the expected payment, ensuring transparency and preventing disputes over non-payment. This initiative is particularly beneficial for the nightclub entertainment industry, where misunderstandings about payment often lead to legal issues. By clarifying payment expectations upfront, the project helps avoid false accusations of coercion. It also caters to clients looking for professional adult entertainment services without the intention of a long-term relationship. Additionally, it eliminates the uncertainty for entertainers about finding clients. The platform is not location-specific and is strictly for service connections, not for finding love or relationships.

Risks
The project faces risks such as clients harming service providers, providers taking payment without delivering services, and potential kidnappings. To mitigate these risks, clients will be directed to recommended hotels, and service providers will have a panic button device for emergencies, with support staff ready to intervene. Providers who accept requests but do not show up will be fined, and clients will be refunded or offered alternative providers. This project aims to ensure that entertainers are compensated and clients receive the services they seek without fear of false accusations.

Infrastructure
Our development process involves creating separate branches from the main codebase to work on new features or fixes, using version control systems like Git. This method allows for isolated work and prevents disruption of the main code. Changes are tested before merging back into the main codebase to resolve any conflicts and ensure functionality.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
We automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. Frequent integration into a central repository triggers automated tests and deployments, enabling faster release cycles.

Containerization
Using technologies like Docker, we package applications with their dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment across different environments.

Content Management System (CMS)
A CMS will be used for data population, allowing data entry directly through a user interface.

APIs and Testing
We will incorporate APIs for structured data access and integration. Testing will involve APIs and a Unit Testing framework in Python. API testing ensures smooth data exchange between applications, verifying functionality, performance, and error handling.

Existing Solutions
Tinder: Shows nearby service providers and their advertised rates. Unlike Tinder, our project ensures clients understand that they are expected to pay for services.
OnlyFans: Allows payments for content subscriptions. Our project involves payments for received services, not content subscriptions.
Origin Story
Inspired by a need for a safe and specific dating space for LGBTQ+ people, we envisioned a platform free from the awkwardness of traditional dating venues. Our dating site, born from shared dreams and late-night planning sessions, aims to provide a sense of belonging and genuine connections.

Technical Challenges in Dating App Development
Crafting a matching algorithm was a significant challenge. We balanced user preferences with a sense of discovery, using a two-tiered system. The first layer filters based on essential criteria, while the second layer considers deeper compatibility factors. Iterative adjustments based on user feedback refined the system, resulting in positive user experiences and meaningful connections.

Building an Adult Entertainment App: Lessons Learned
Developing this app involved mastering data protection, ensuring anonymity, and optimising backend infrastructure. Prioritising tight deadlines sometimes meant sacrificing accessibility standards, highlighting the need for long-term vision. The project fostered personal growth, teaching resilience and the importance of scalability and performance optimization. It also underscored the necessity of multi-layered security approaches and agile development practices.

Personal Statement
I am Morena Macheka, a dedicated software engineering student, passionate about problem-solving and building innovative solutions with code. Completing my first project was challenging yet rewarding, and I am eager to tackle larger projects and further refine my skills.
